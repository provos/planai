## Quick Example

```python
from planai import Graph, TaskWorker, Task, LLMTaskWorker, llm_from_config

# Define a simple data processor
class DataProcessor(TaskWorker):
    output_types = [ProcessedData]
    
    def consume_work(self, task: RawData):
        processed = self.process(task.data)
        self.publish_work(ProcessedData(data=processed))

# Add AI analysis with an LLM
class AIAnalyzer(LLMTaskWorker):
    prompt = "Analyze the data and provide insights"
    output_types = [AnalysisResult]

# Create and run the workflow
graph = Graph(name="Analysis Pipeline")
processor = DataProcessor()
analyzer = AIAnalyzer(llm=llm_from_config("openai", "gpt-4"))

graph.add_workers(processor, analyzer)
graph.set_dependency(processor, analyzer)
graph.run(initial_tasks=[(processor, RawData(data="..."))])
```
