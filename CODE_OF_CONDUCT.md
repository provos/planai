# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to create a welcoming, inclusive, and productive community. We value diverse perspectives, open communication, and mutual respect. Our goal is to foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas, giving feedback, and collaborating effectively.

## Our Standards

To build a positive community, we encourage:

* Empathy and kindness in all interactions
* Respectful consideration of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Constructive feedback, given and received gracefully
* Taking responsibility for our actions and learning from our mistakes
* Focusing on what's best for the overall community
* Using humor to create connections, not to alienate or offend
* Self-awareness and reflection on our own behaviors and biases

## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are committed to:

* Clarifying and upholding these community standards
* Fostering an atmosphere of trust and psychological safety
* Addressing concerns promptly and fairly
* Leading by example in our interactions and contributions

## Resolving Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that doesn't align with our community standards, please reach out to the project team. We will review and address all concerns confidentially and work towards a resolution that maintains the health of our community.

## A Note on Growth

As our community grows, we may need to evolve this Code of Conduct to address new challenges. We welcome input from all community members in this process.

Remember, we're all human. Mistakes happen. What matters most is how we learn and grow from them. Let's create a community where we can laugh together, learn together, and build amazing things together.
